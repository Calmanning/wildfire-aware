ABOUT THIS APP

The Wildfire Aware app is intended to provide information about the current status and potential impact of wildfire incidents in the United States. This app opens with the list of fires sorted by the number of personnel assigned from greatest to least as reported by incident staff. The data included in this application can all be found in ArcGIS Living Atlas and are from authoritative entities.
USE THIS APP

Select a fire from the list, change the sort option to date, name or size, or use shift and your mouse to draw a box and zoom in. Once you have selected a fire or clicked on the map, details will be displayed in the information panel on the right giving you more information about a wildfire along with impacts to human and ecosystem populations. You can also sort by wildfire name, date or size, by selecting the relevant filter in the information pane.

PERSONNEL BREAKDOWNS
The categories below represent the number of personnel assigned.
fires with 500 or more people assigned

> 500: Fires with the largest number of assigned personnel often require larger incident management team involvement.
> fires with personnel between 50 to 500
> 50-500: Greater complexity requires a higher number of personnel and potentially an incident management team.
> fires with less than 50 personnel
> 1-50: This number of personnel could indicate a smaller, less complex incident or one that is nearing the end of its primary response efforts.
> fire with no personnel reported
> Not Reported: New fires, smaller fires that are easier to contain, or fires that are near the end of their life cycle may not report the number of ‘personnel assigned’. This should in no way be taken as an indication that the fire is unstaffed or otherwise receiving no response.
> Prescribed fire
> Prescribed Fire: These fires are intentional and planned events.
